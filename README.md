# Demonstrating Phase Kickback in Quantum Computing with Qiskit

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Demonstrate the phase kickback phenomenon using a simple two-qubit quantum circuit in Qiskit, showing how a controlled phase rotation applied to the target qubit affects the control qubit.

## ðŸ“š Theoretical Background
In quantum computing, when a control qubit is in superposition and a controlled gate (like `CRZ(Î¸)`) is applied, the phase can "kick back" from the target to the control. This highlights the unitary and reversible nature of quantum operations â€” a key distinction from classical computing.

## ðŸ§ª Experiment Steps

1. Initialize a 2-qubit quantum circuit.
2. Apply `H` to the control qubit (superposition) and `X` to the target (sets it to |1âŸ©).
3. Apply a `CRZ(Î¸)` gate â€” phase affects only the target if control is |1âŸ©.
4. Apply a final `H` to the control â€” reveals the phase as a measurable difference.
5. Visualize the statevector and Bloch spheres.
6. Simulate and measure results using `AerSimulator`.

## ðŸ§  Why It Matters
Phase kickback is a key mechanism in:
- Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE)
- Shorâ€™s Algorithm
- Quantum simulations

## ðŸ“Š Visualization
- Statevector amplitudes
- Bloch sphere representations
- Measurement histograms (with and without the final Hadamard)
